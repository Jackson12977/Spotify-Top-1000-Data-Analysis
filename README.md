# Spotify-Top-1000-Data-Analysis
This spotify dataset was gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/spotify-top-10000-streamed-songs 

Some questions answered by this Analysis;
i. Best streamed artist on spotify.
ii. Most streamed song on spotify.
iii. Artist and how many times they've been in top ten.
iv. Artist with the most revenue generated.
v. Song that generated the most revenue.


My major problem analyzing this dataset was that there was no specified amount per stream so i did my calculation and also i don't how up to date it is.
